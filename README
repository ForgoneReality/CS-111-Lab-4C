INCLUDED FILES:

lab4c_tcp.c: Source file TCP connection for temperature detection in the beaglebone. Added
3 new commands --host, --id, and --log (which is now mandatory) as well as the
necessary port number positional argument. Much of it is implemented on lab4b

lab4c_tls.c: Source file for SSL connection implemented over the previous lab4c_tcp. 

README: This file which describes the four files and miscellaneous comments

Makefile: The makefile for this project. A standard makefile except that it checks
whether or not uname -a has "armv7l" to determine whether or not to include
the dummy thing. 

Limitations/Relevant Comments:
It should be noted that my AIO failed to initalize for my temperature sensor on my
beaglebone and as a result, I had to use the dummy options to run on my end. I use uname -a
and searching for armv7l

Research:

DISCUSSION SLIDES! Especially for the second part, I pretty much copy and pasted from the slides
and did some editing for error codes.

I also had some issue with Sublime Text and transferring tabs/spaces to VIM and had to google that
